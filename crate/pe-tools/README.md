so, please be careful when using it.</br>

## There are other crates like the PE parser, why not use it?
The answer is that I want a function that is easier to use.</br>
Parsers like pelite and goblin are great, but I thought they were good for "analysis" and not for playing around with PE directly.</br>
If it's a problem with my usage, give me an example. i will consider using a crate.</br>
