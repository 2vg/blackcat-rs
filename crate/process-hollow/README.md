## details
This code was written in Rust based on [m0n0ph1/Process-Hollowing](https://github.com/m0n0ph1/Process-Hollowing).</br>
The original checked only Eax at the entry point, so it looked like 32bit.</br>
I made it compatible with 64bit.</br>
payload-sample.exe is crate/payload-sample.</br>
But yes, I can't prove that it's not a real bad sample here, so set your own responsibility or put another payload yourself.</br>
