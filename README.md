## Disclaimer
**Code samples are provided for educational purposes. Adequate defenses can only be built by researching attack techniques available to malicious actors. Using this code against target systems without prior permission is illegal in most jurisdictions. The authors are not liable for any damages from misuse of this information or code**.
and, Don't ask me about creating specific tools using these techniques (I'll ignore them altogether).</br>
I don't want to exploit this, I just want to know how it works just curious, I'm not writing code to attack others.

## usage
`If you are interested in these, you should know how to use them`</br>
If you are interested in this repository, i guess you already know some knowledge.</br>
So I'll leave the code, but I won't explain them all.

## What, cat
First, **still under development, it goes slowly.**</br>
This repository contains the code I researched and wrote.</br>
I'm not a security technician, I've been researching these for a long time just out of my curiosity.</br>
To protect yourself from attacks, it's much better to know how to attack. </br>
You've played some game. Haven't you ever looked up an enemy to make it easier to clear? No, it's not.</br></br>
I'm still inexperienced and may have some wrong code and some code that doesn't work.</br>
I think I was a script kiddie when I first learned(?) about these.</br>
I don't know how it works, I checked the tools I downloaded on the web and I thought I was a Hacker.</br>
I can write a little code now, but it may still be a script kiddie. because noob programmer.</br>
So I will investigate these, write code, make them work, and try to understand them... as long as my curiosity continues :3</br>
So, if you can tell me about these, create issues and PRs to grow me♡

## Okey, but why not **C**, why **Rust**?
Good question, but the answer to this is because I like Rust. That's all.

## Plans?
see #Todo section.</br>
i will update that list, when i got other plans, other ideas.

## Contribute
WELCOME ANYTIME

## Todo

- [ ] hollow (currently forcused)
- [ ] other 2 or 3 injection methods (yes, for crypter)
- [ ] create simple crypter ..1
- [ ] reverse tcp with e2e connection
- [ ] r\*\*\*\*it
- [ ] research c\*\*\*\*t s\*\*\*\*e
- [ ] research b\*\*\*k dll
- [ ] w*n hook
- [ ] km ..2

.. etc.
