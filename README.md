## What, cat
First, **still under development, it goes slowly.**</br>
This repository contains the code I researched and wrote.</br>
I'm not a security technician, I've been researching these for a long time just out of my curiosity.</br>
To protect yourself from attacks, it's much better to know how to attack. </br>
You've played some game. Haven't you ever looked up an enemy to make it easier to clear? No, it's not.</br></br>
I'm still inexperienced and may have some wrong code and some code that doesn't work.</br>
I think I was a script kiddie when I first learned(?) about these.</br>
I don't know how it works, I checked the tools I downloaded on the web and I thought I was a Hacker.</br>
I can write a little code now, but it may still be a script kiddie. because noob programmer.</br>
So I will investigate these, write code, make them work, and try to understand them... as long as my curiosity continues :3</br>
So, if you can tell me about these, create issues and PRs to grow me♡

# Okey, but why not **C**, why **Rust**?
Good question, but the answer to this is because I like Rust. That's all.

## usage
`If you are interested in these, you should know how to use them`</br>
If you are interested in this repository, i guess you already know some knowledge.</br>
So I'll leave the code, but I won't explain them all.
